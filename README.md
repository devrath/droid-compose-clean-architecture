## **`𝙸𝚗𝚝𝚛𝚘𝚍𝚞𝚌𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗`** 💡
:label: This repository serves as template and demo for building android applications for scale. It is suited for large teams where individuals can work independently on feature wise and layer wise reducing the dependency on each other. It is built with pure kotlin in the project namely `compose` for the `presentation-layer`, `kotlin` for writing the `business-logic`, `kotlin-dsl` for handeling the dependencies. </br>
:label: `Single activity` architecture where `compose-navigation` is used for navigating between the screens. Also care is taken so that dependencies used in `presentation layer` is not available for `domain layer` and `data layer`. Multimodule architecture used with `reusability` by adhering `SOLID-principles`, also `unit-testing`, `integration-testing` in mind. `Coding for abstraction rather than implementation` is followed in the project that enables `testing` and so that `fakes` can be easily provided for abstractions for testing individual components.

:bricks::bricks: Application is under constant improvement :bricks::bricks:

:label: Programming language: :heavy_minus_sign: By migrating away from Java and towards kotlin, we can leverage the features like better readability, null saftey, less code, benifits of improved syntax and others. </br>
:label: Kotlin DSL: :heavy_minus_sign: Earlier we used to use gradle for organizing dependencies. Gradle is written in a groovy programming language. Using the kotlin-DSL, we can organize the dependencies in our project cleaner and in an efficient way. Type safety. This allows better autocompletion which was missing from grovey till now. Code navigation between files becomes easy in Kotlin DSL. Refactoring is much easier. </br>
:label: Compose: :heavy_minus_sign: Earlier we had xml for building the UI and thus there was one more language hooked to android project. But with the addition of jetpack compose, Even the UI will be built in kotlin language.

:label: Scalability: :heavy_minus_sign: When new features are added, using the clean architecture we can easily add the new features and maintain old existing features without breaking them. </br>
:label: Testability: :heavy_minus_sign: For the new features, its essential we write a code that can be tested for all possible inputs so that once in production we can forecast all possible scenarios and handle them. </br>
:label: Understandable: :heavy_minus_sign:  Scaling a product with keeping the code testable is good but its also should be in such a way that everyone should understand it and also should easily be modify it.

:label: A multi module project helps us to segrigate between the layers of code in the project and enforcing strict seperation of concerns. </br>
:label: When working on a large project this will keep the team to work in layer wise and also feature wise. </br>
:label: A change in one feature will not affect other features in the project. </br>

:label: A Depencency Injection results in a loosely coupled programs. It helps to achieve inversion of control. Inversion of control means a object or function recieves another object or function as a dependency. </br>
:label: We use hilt that is built on top of dagger tool that generates code on behalf of user and helps to attain the inversion control easily. This is very essential because all the extra code that we need to generate, hilt will do it for us. </br>
:label: The inversion control becomes even more crucial part of the structure in case of multi module project. </br>
:label: This also helps in unit testing thte code because, since object is not created and instead provided to a function, we can easily mock it during unit testing. </br>

:label: Presentation Layer: :heavy_minus_sign: This layer is the UI layer of the application, It contains composables and view-models. The presentation layer communicates with the domain layer, But the presentation layer is not aware of the data layer. </br> 
:label: Domain Layer: :heavy_minus_sign: This layer contains use cases that contain business logic that perform one functionality each. It also contains the interfaces that communicates with repository which is present in the data layer. </br>
:label: Data Layer: :heavy_minus_sign: The data layer contains the repositries, The repository can be a preference repository, remote API, local-filesystem etc. The data layer communicates back with the domain layer after fetching the data. </br>

*This applicaion is developed keeping in mind of clean architecture principles*
| SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY | OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPLE | LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE | INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE | DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Each class having one responsibility. If there is a change in it, it must be because of only one reason only. If there are two reasons for a class to change, then it violates single responsibility principle. | This indicates that the class is open for extension but closed for modification | When we have a class that is inheriting the parent, the parent class functionality must be replaceable using the child class without modifying the functionality of parent class | Here we should not force a class to do something that it does not want to do, Say a class is implementing interface then it overrides all the functions in it. Now if we don’t want a function of interface to be implemented then we give the default behaviour for the interface and so that it will not force the child class to override that method | This indicates that, a class must depend on abstraction instead of concrete implementation. Say we want a implementation to be used for a class thence need to inject a abstraction for it instead of concrete implementation so that if its implementation changes in future , it must not affect where the abstract version of it is implemented |

#### **`𝙰𝚍𝚟𝚊𝚗𝚝𝚊𝚐𝚎𝚜`**
| `Clear separation` | `Faster build time` |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| • Each of the modules is a library and it can depend on each other <br> • If there is a scenario where one library is not dependent on another, Then they can't access each other <br> • Thus, instead of adding terms of separate packages in the app module, we can enforce strict modularity by modularising it <br> • In a large project and big team we can enforce, who works on which project. Thus one person working on one won't affect other modules| • Using the multi-module we can decrease the build time. When in multi-module each module will use separate threads so build time will decrease since all modules will build independently <br> • Since Gradle needs to build the module that has been changed, it doesn't need to make the modules that have not been changed <br> • Point to note here is that, say there is a root module with few child modules, if the root module changes, all the child modules also need to rebuild <br> • Support for `instant apps` and `dynamic feature module` <br> • Using this we can make parts of our app reusable |

#### **`𝙳𝚒𝚜𝚊𝚍𝚟𝚊𝚗𝚝𝚊𝚐𝚎𝚜`**
 • Lot of initial code <br>
 • Not knowing what problem it will cause

 :label: Implementations of repositories sits in the data layer.<br/>
 :label: The Data layer has reference to domain layer, So it can access all the classes from the data layer.<br/>
 :label: Presentation layer has reference to the domain layer, so it can access all the classes from the domain layer and not data layer.<br/>
 :label: We alwaays inject abstractions to any class instead of concrete implementation.<br/>
 :label: Data flows from presentation layer to data layer if data is saved locally or sent to server. In other case the data is retrieved from data layer to presentation layer in case when data is retrieved from server to UI displayed or from data saved locally to UI displayed<br/>

:label: Basically You just follow steps to create a firebase account and eanable authentication module, I have summarized some steps below.<br/>
:one: Before running the sample application, Please create a account in firebase console.<br/>
:two: Now enable the authentication in settings for firebase(This is used during the authentication of login).<br/>
:three: Add the google-services.json in the app level of the project that is obtained when creating a project in firebase.<br/> 
:four: Last but not least add your application SHA in your firebase settings.<br/>

## **`𝙲𝚞𝚛𝚛𝚎𝚗𝚝𝚕𝚢 𝚏𝚎𝚊𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎𝚜 𝚍𝚎𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚘𝚙𝚎𝚍`** 🧰
Demo contains three screen application namely `registration`, `login`, `forgot-password` and external service used here is `firebase`. User can create an account using `registration`. User can login and once login is successful the user details is saved in `data-store` </br>
<div align="center">
 
`Login` | `Registration` | `Forgot Password` |
